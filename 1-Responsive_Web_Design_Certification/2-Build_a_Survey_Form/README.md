# Responsive Web-Design - Project #2
## Build a Survey Form

## Introduction

This is another simple html/css project aimed at using the basics.
Here the purpose was to generate a form along with the most common form tags. 
I've used a simple CSS Grid to have the list of the requirement on the left-side of the screen, while the form itself is on the right side. If the screen is too small, then the requirements will appear below the form.

## Technologies
* HTML5
