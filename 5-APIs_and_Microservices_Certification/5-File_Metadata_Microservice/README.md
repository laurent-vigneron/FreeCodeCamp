# API Project - Project #5 - File Metadata

## Introduction
I was confused by that project, as it was very easy and fast to complete. I thought I'd forgotten something, but no...
I've used the express-fileupload library instead of the multer one.
Both of them put the data about the file(s) in `req.files`.

### User stories:
1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field  has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

### Usage :
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

### Hint:
* To handle the file uploading you should use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.
