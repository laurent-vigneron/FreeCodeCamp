## Projects #1 to #5

## Introduction

The projects presented here each represent a specific problem that needed to be solved using a JavaScript function.
* Palindrome Checker
    Returns true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, returns false.
* Roman Numeral Converter
    Converts the given number into a roman numeral.
* Caesars Cipher
    Also known as a shift cipher, letters are shifted by some set amount. Here it is a ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.
    This is a function that takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
* Telephone Number Validator
    Returns true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number. A good candidate for RegEx.
* Cash Register
    Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.
    The use-cases are better explained [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register)
