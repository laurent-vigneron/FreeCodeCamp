# Data-Visualization - Project #3
## Build a Heat Map

## Introduction

In this third project I'm going to create a Heat-Map to visualize the slow but steady raise in temperature in the last 250+ years.
There is also a legend with gradual values, which is a new addition compared to previous project. For that part I've used the d3-legend js library.
