# Data-Visualization - Project #5
## Build a Treemap Diagram

## Introduction
For this project I had the choice of 3 different sources of Data. I took the 'Movies' one.
For me the most complicated part was not the diagram itself but how to have the text in each cell to wrap correctly.
StackOverflow was a good source, but as always there was some adaptation required.
The Legend also took me a little bit of time to figure out.
All in all these 5 d3 projects were interesting, and they show how powerful it can be to provide a visual representation of what can otherwise be abstract data.
